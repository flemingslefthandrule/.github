**What does it mean?**

Fleming's Left Hand Rule is a mnemonic device used to remember the direction of the magnetic force (F) on a current-carrying wire in a magnetic field. The rule states that if you hold your left hand with your thumb, index finger, and middle finger at right angles to each other, and:

* **F** (Thumb) points in the direction of the **Force** (F) experienced by the wire
* **I** (Index finger) points in the direction of the **Current** (I) flowing through the wire
* **B** (Middle finger) points in the direction of the **Magnetic Field** (B) produced by the wire

**Why did we choose this name?**

We're a group of innovators who appreciate the beauty of physics and its ability to inspire creative solutions. By adopting Fleming's Left Hand Rule as our namesake, we're reminded of the power of simple, intuitive ideas that can have a profound impact on our understanding of the world.

So, whether you're a physics enthusiast or just curious about the world around you, we're glad you're here!
